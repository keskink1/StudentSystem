# StudentSystem

A simple **Student Management System** built with **Java 1.8** and **JavaServer Faces (JSF)**.  
The project demonstrates CRUD operations for managing students in a web-based environment.

## Features
- **JSF-based frontend** with XHTML pages.

- **Relational database integration** (MySQL or similar).
- **PrimeFaces support** (if included in the UI for rich components).

## Technologies Used
- **Java 1.8**
- **JSF 2.x**
- **Maven** (project management)
- **MySQL** (or any JDBC-compatible database)
- **PrimeFaces** (optional, for UI components)
- **WildFly / Tomcat** (as application server)
